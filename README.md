Belly Button Biodiversity

A dashboard that explores the biodiversity of the human belly button, also catalogs the microbes that inhabite the naval of humans.

This dataset consisted of 661 participants, on avergae they scrubbed their belly buttons twice a week. We are looking at microbial species 
(also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs) in the study. In this dataset, a small handful of OTUs were present in more than 70% of people, 
while the rest were relatively rare.

Dashboard Features:
A drop down menu, demigraphic info paneel, horizontal bar graph, a gauge chart, and bubble chart.

You can use the drop down to see a particular participant in the study. 
The demographic panel shows information about the participants in the study.
The horizontal bar graph is generated when someone is selected from the drop down. The top 10 OTUs found in that test subject will be displayed in bars. 
When a user hover over a bar, the otu_labels are presented as the hovertext for the chart. 
The gauge chart is generate when someone is selected from the drop down. The value of srubs per week is display on chart with a blue colored bar. 
The bubble chart, is generated when a test subject is selected on the drop menu. Each sample will be display as a bubble, where the larger the sample value is the larger the bubble size.
On the chart, the x values are the otu_ids, the y values are the sample_values. The colors of the bubbles are based on otu_ids, and the hovertext are the otu_labels.
